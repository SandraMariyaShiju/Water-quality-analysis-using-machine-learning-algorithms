# Water-quality-analysis-using-machine-learning-algorithms
The primary aim of the project is to analyze the potability and suitability for irrigation of crops from the Medium and Minor Rivers of India Under National Water Quality Monitoring Programme (NWMP).
The objective is to analyze the water potability and suitability for irrigation of crops using various machine learning algorithms like Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, XGBClassifier, Support Vector Machine.
The project provides the solution for identifying the water quality and to predict water potability and water suitability for irrigation of crops from Medium and Minor Rivers of different states in India Under National Water Quality Monitoring Programme (NWMP).
